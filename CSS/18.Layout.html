				South Korea is now a global player among Indo-Pacific countries that has to do its part for freedom, 
				peace and prosperity in the region in order to take the next leap, Foreign Minister Park Jin said Wednesday.
				The minister made the remarks while unveiling the country’s Indo-Pacific strategy -- the latest foreign 
				policy summarizing the steps needed to expand Korea’s global imprint.
				The plan presented by the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, promised back in 
				May when it took power, comes amid a global rush to gain an advantage in a region dominated by the 
				growing US-China rivalry over strategic economic as well as security interests.

				But the plan, which includes working with countries in as far as 
				Europe and Central and South America, still faces doubts from critics. 
				They question not only the effectiveness of such far-reaching 
				outreach but the fact that the plan parrots the US’ campaign, which seeks a “free and open” 
				Indo-Pacific rooted in international norms as part of efforts to put checks on an increasingly assertive China.
